/**
 * Nigerian bank codes (CBN).

 * Hardcoded because the API exposes no bank list endpoint — payout takes a
 * `bankCode` and validates nothing about it, so an unlisted or mistyped code
 * would fail at the payment processor rather than here. A short, correct list
 * is safer than a free-text box.
